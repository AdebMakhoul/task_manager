Here is the first version on this project:

 I developed this structure in the most optimal way in my opinion, and tried with the short time that I have to make the code clean as much as possible, you can check all the layers
 and how I make it responnsible for any adds like if I want to translate the application to any language, add map, ..etc
Using bloc, sqlite, dio, getx, injectable,firebase and many useful library, I tried to develop my structure to the most.
This structure is able to develop in any way you demand. 

what I accomplished in this version:
- login with the dummy users mentioned in the assessment.
- get the tasks
-save the tasks locally in sqlite db and can access to it even if the telephone is not connected to hte internet.
-add task
-update the state of the task ( if it's completed or not)
-delete the task.
-pagination.
-unit test for adding a new task to the local sqlite db.


Thanks for ur time :)
